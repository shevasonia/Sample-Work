This repository shows a portfolio of what I have done during my time as a Research Assistant and Student. In addition to these files, I also have experience in Geodatabase using ArcMap. 
Methods I have done include, but are not limited to: regular OLS, IV, Spatial Conley, Dyadic model with multiple IV, Placebo IV, etc. 
My research experience focuses mostly on Development Economics, Economics History, and Applied Econometrics, using Micro-, Meso-, and Macro-level data.

The documents here are uploaded purely to show my experience and capability to future recruiters or project managers. All work is courtesy of Sheva Sonia Rahmani and usage for others is strictly prohibited without Sheva Sonia Rahmani's consent.
